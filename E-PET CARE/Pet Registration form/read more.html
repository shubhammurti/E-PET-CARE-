        <p>We all love our pets, but sometimes it's hard for us to give them the time they need. Pets also need love, care, and attention, especially if your pet is a dog. No matter which breed of dog you have, it is important for you to take him out for a nice walk. However, as already mentioned, time constraints make it difficult for us to do so.</p>
        <p>To make lives easy, digital solutions have paved the way to solve all human problems. Cutting-edge technology has found its way to solve dog walking problems too, and dog walks application forms. Earlier, dog owners had to find dog walkers before time, as the dog walking business worked offline. However, that is quite a hassle, and what if the dog owner has late work hours?</p>
        <h2>We are giving the four services</h2>
        <h3>1. Dog walking</h3>
        <p>Dog walking means is the act of a person walking with a dog, typically from the dog's residence and then returning through our services are created for Dog owner’s who busy for some other work or else they going for outside the city these website help to take care of owners pets. We will provide the services to your dog will be in the safe hand your dog will enjoy our services</p>
         <h4>What is a Dog Walker?</h4>
         <p>Do you love spending time with dogs? Would you prefer working outside over being cooped up in an office? You may want to consider becoming a dog walker!

            Walking a dog is part of the daily exercise regime needed in order to keep a dog healthy and happy. However, there are times when dog owners are unable to take their dog(s) out for their much needed walks, and that's where the services of a dog walker comes in.</p>
          <h4>What does a Dog Walker do?</h4> 
          <p>Dog walkers can either be independent business owners or part of a larger dog-walking business. They are typically paid by the half hour or by the hour which allows dog owners to get out of the house and do errands, work overtime, or take some time away. Having a dog walker means knowing that their dog will get the care and exercise they need.</p>
          <p>A dog walker will typically pick the dog up at the owner's house, take it out for its walk, and return the animal back to the house. Some dog walkers take many dogs for a walk at the same time, while others prefer to take only one at a time. Some, especially those who own their own business, may choose to include grooming services as well.</p> 
          <p>Dog walkers need to have complete control, as they may be walking several dogs at a time, and need to have full authority so that one does not get away from the group. In some cases, a walker may have to deal with breaking up dogs in a fight, or with runaways. Physical stamina is sometimes necessary.</p>
          <p>Some other requirements of the job are:

            A being comfortable working with pet owners
            B coordinating many schedules at a time
            C having an understanding of animal restraints and the use of transportation kennels
            D having the ability to control dogs of various sizes
            E obtaining and updating licenses or permits (if necessary)</p>
            <p>A dog walker also needs to clean up after the dog and make sure that no droppings are left behind. While this is arguably one of the worst aspects of the job, dog walkers are animal lovers and know that it is all part of taking care of the animal.</p>
            <p>One of the most important aspects of becoming a dog walker is finding clients who can trust you to take care of their pet. In many cases, dog walkers will be given a key to the residence while the owner is at work. This means that dog walkers must be very respectful and trustworthy in order to gain new clients and keep them.</p>
        <h3>2. Pet training</h3>
        <p>Animal training is the act of teaching animals specific responses to specific conditions or stimuli. Training may be for purposes such as companionship, detection, protection, and entertainment. The type of training an animal receives will vary depending on the training method used, and the purpose for training the animal. For example, a seeing eye dog will be trained to achieve a different goal than a wild animal in a circus.</p>
        <p>In some countries animal trainer certification bodies exist. They do not share consistent goals or requirements; they do not prevent someone from practicing as an animal trainer nor using the title. Similarly, the United States does not require animal trainers to have any specific certification.[1] An animal trainer should consider the natural behaviors of the animal and aim to modify behaviors through a basic system of reward and punishment.</p>
        <h4>Currently we give trainig for Dog's only</h4>
        <h3>Dog's</h3> 
        <p>Basic obedience training tasks for dogs, include walking on a leash, attention, housebreaking, nonaggression, and socialization with humans or other pets. Dogs are also trained for many other activities, such as dog sports, service dogs, and working dog tasks.

            Positive reinforcement for dogs can include primary reinforcers like food or social reinforcers, such as vocal ("good boy") or tactile (stroking) ones. Positive punishment, if used at all, can be physical, such as pulling on a leash or spanking. It may also be vocal, such as saying "bad dog". Bridges to positive reinforcement, include vocal cues, whistling, and dog whistles, as well as clickers used in clicker training, a method popularized by Karen Pryor. Negative reinforcement may also be used. Punishment is also a tool, including withholding of food or physical discipline.</p>

            <p><b>Dog Disease Basics</b></p>
            <p>
                Modern medicine has made dogs' lives much more pleasant, and longer for sure. But there are illnesses that will always be part of dog life, and these are made more threatening because dogs often come in contact with other animals, which can transmit diseases to them. In fact, there are some diseases that can be transmitted from dog to man. So you need to be familiar with diseases such as rabies, distemper and others, in order to prevent them or catch them early in your own dog.
